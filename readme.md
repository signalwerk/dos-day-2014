# QBasic demo – dos-day 2014
This is a small demo written in qbasic. Coded by @messagemaetens and signalwerk at the dos-day 2014 in Schaffhausen (Switzerland). Every year odenwilusenz.ch hosts a meeting about old computers and retro stuff.
It took us nearly as long to code the demo as it took us to transfer the file to an internet enabled computer.
